# recursive_methods
Methods that utilize recursion instead of iteration

Different problem sets can be solved using a variety of algorithms. Recursion is a type of algorithm in which a function or method calls itself to help "divide and conquer" problems. In this project, recursion will be used to solve:

- Fibonacci Sequence
- Merge Sort
